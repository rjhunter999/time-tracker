# time-tracker
Track my time from the command line.

I tried a popular time tracking app, but I didn't want to have to keep opening my phone. I also did this on Excel for a while, but it was too clunky. Thus I build this slim python script to easily track my time from the command line.

Execute with:

```bash
./time_tracker.py -h
```
